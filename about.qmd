## Introductions
My name is Sean Switzer i'm a sophmore at georgetown college and am looking to major in 
software design and programming. 

## Background and Today
I was introduced to programming in a highschool engineering course, in which we started
learning the C# language to use with vex robotics programming. Following this introduction 
I fell in love with programming and the many puzzles it provides, I went on to study javascript
in an AP computer science course learning the history of computing, the use of binary, hexadecimal, and ascii.
I started working on programs that could be run on mobile devices and programmed a basic time based clicker
game. Now I am currently attending my third computer science class CSC 324 and looking to further my studies in the following semesters.
